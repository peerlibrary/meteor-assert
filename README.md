assert smart package
====================

Meteor smart package for [assert](http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) node.js module.

Adding this package to your [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) application adds `assert` object into the global scope,
which you can use to make various assertions in your code. It works both on server and client. For client
environment it uses [this port](https://github.com/Jxck/assert).
